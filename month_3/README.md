# Challenge Month 3

## Problem Statement
You are an evil supervillain, who wants to rule the world! (Who doesn't?)
Unfortunately, your archnemesis, the superhero with super-speed, Speedy, always foils your plans!
It isn't this that you're mad about though, there are plenty of superheroes out there who would foil your plans anyway- No.
You're mad that Speedy running around always damages your nicely carpeted base! Running around at super-speed sure does
leave some ugly marks! The renovation costs alone were in the millions!

Taking it personally, you want to find out their identity, and so you head over to the black market, and buy some data. 
This is the data from a network sniffer from a compromised popular Coffee Franchise called  CoffeeBucks, with chains all over town. 
Perhaps you could use this to your advantage? If your archnemesis slipped up, perhaps they accidentally ran at super-speed
from one shop to another with their phone in their pocket, then you can figure out if they regularly go to one of the chains once a week at a certain time? 
You'd be able to spy on them then!

Using a map, you map out the locations and the minimum amount of time it would take for a non-superpowered individual without superspeed to travel to the location.

Area 1:
    Area 2: 5 minutes
    Area 3: 65 minutes
    Area 4: 40 minutes
    Area 5: 80 minutes
Area 2:
    Area 3: 60 minutes
    Area 4: 30 minutes
    Area 5: 70 minutes
Area 3:
    Area 4: 30 minutes
    Area 5: 10 minutes
Area 4:
    Area 5: 40 minutes

## Out-Of-Universe Details:

The zip file with the pcap files can be found in this git directory as `MarchChallenge.zip`.
The paper can be found in `./paper/paper.pdf`. Note that there are also easier ways to solve it than
the way I mention in the document, those methods are left as an exercise to the reader.

To be eligible to submit the solution and receive the prize, you need to be a monash student.

In the answer, please DO NOT specify the MAC Address of Speedy, instead, give the time and area they usually hang out. For example, if they are regularly in Area 1 on Mondays 11pm, say that instead. The approximate time can be given, as the time usually is a bit different (e.g: sometimes they come at 11:02pm or 10:59pm).
